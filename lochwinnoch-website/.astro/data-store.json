It keeps people informed, fosters a sense of belonging, and ensures that no matter how small or remote a community may seem, its voice is heard. However, in recent years, many local newspapers and community platforms have faced financial challenges, leading to closures and reduced coverage. This is not just the loss of a business—it’s the erosion of a vital part of Scotland’s cultural fabric.\n\nThe Case for Preserving Local Community News\n\n1. The Impact on Community Spirit\n   Local news outlets are more than just newspapers; they are the backbone of community engagement. They report on local events, school achievements, and public issues that directly affect residents. Without them, communities lose a platform to discuss matters that impact their daily lives. For example, closures of local pubs, schools, or businesses often go underreported without these outlets, leaving residents feeling disconnected and unheard.\n\n2. The Economic Concerns\n   While the immediate financial challenges are undeniable, the long-term economic impact of losing local news is even greater. When communities feel ignored or uninformed, they become disengaged. This disengagement can lead to lower voter turnout, reduced participation in local decision-making, and a decline in local entrepreneurship. A thriving community needs an informed citizenry, and that starts with preserving local journalism.\n\n3. The Role of Technology\n   Some argue that the internet and social media have made traditional news outlets obsolete. However, while digital platforms offer new opportunities for storytelling, they often lack the depth and focus that local newspapers provide. A community Facebook page or Twitter feed may spread information quickly, but it doesn’t replace the curated, in-depth coverage that a professional journalist can deliver.\n\n### The Way Forward\n\nTo preserve local community news in Scotland, we need a multi-faceted approach:\n\n- Support Local Publishers: Encourage readers to subscribe to local newspapers and share their content on social media. Even a small contribution can make a difference.\n\n- Government Funding: Advocate for public funding or subsidies to help struggling local outlets stay afloat. Many European countries have successful models for supporting local journalism through grants or tax incentives.\n\n- Community-Led Initiatives: Empower residents to take ownership of their news by creating cooperatives or volunteer-run platforms. This ensures that the community’s voice remains central to the narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, the fight to preserve local community news in Scotland is not just about saving a business—it’s about safeguarding our democracy, our culture, and our sense of place. Let us rally together to ensure that no matter how small or remote a Scottish community may be, its stories continue to be told.","src/content/news/news-1.md","083a2b3159c502a5",{"html":29,"metadata":30},"\u003Ch3 id=\"the-mock-argument-for-preserving-local-community-news-in-scotland\">The Mock Argument for Preserving Local Community News in Scotland\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Local community news is the lifeblood of Scotland’s towns and villages.

Land reform would ensure that ordinary Scots have a fair chance to secure tenancies or ownership, reducing inequality.\n\n- Economic Benefits for Local Areas: Concentrated land ownership often leads to underutilized resources and missed economic opportunities. By redistributing land, communities can generate new businesses, create jobs, and stimulate local economies. For example, small-scale farming initiatives could thrive if more people had access to land.\n\n- Empowering Communities: Land is not just a resource—it’s a symbol of heritage and self-determination.

Have a look at the press release and then read on.\n\nThe National Lottery approved our application for £198,250 which, added to £233,500 from the Scottish Land Fund, will enable us to proceed with the purchase of the church and bring in consultants to look in detail at what needs to be done to help us achieve the ideas that came from the community consultation we ran almost a year ago.\n\nIn addition, we may have secured a potential £1.9 million (also from the National Lottery) to cover the cost of a lot of the essential work that will be required to repair and renovate the building.\n\nThis still leaves us £1.4 million short of the amount estimated to be needed to cover the remainder of the conservation work and to refurbish the building to make it fit for our needs. We will continue to contact funding organisations to seek support but we may also look at opportunities closer to home to make a dent in the current (and hopefully reducing) shortfall.\n\nNow that we are able to share our news, we will keep you advised of progress on a regular basis.\n\nIt has taken a long time, but now we are starting this exciting journey, and we look forward to you joining us on it.\n\nWE are pleased to announce – the Scottish Land Fund have awarded funds to enable us to purchase the property. See announcement here.\n\nThe challenge\n\nWe will need to raise a substantial sum likely to be in excess of £3.5 million to cover:\n\n1. Immediate and essential repairs (including work to the roof and heating system to stave off potential problems over the coming winter),\n\n2.

A committee of our members have worked very hard on this project, conducting surveys to discover what the community wanted from a park, liaising with equipment suppliers to create designs and budgets for a fully upgraded play park, an intergenerational seating area and a space for teenagers, with local media to raise awareness, and with council representatives to find out what might be possible on the site itself.\n\n• We successfully applied to two major Renfrewshire Council funds, winning £30,000 from the Villages Investment Fund and £50,000 from the Green Spaces fund; we also oversaw the Community Olympics event, which saw teams of villagers competing in sponsored events throughout April and raised almost £10,000 towards the renovation.\n\n• Because of the success of the project, the level of community engagement and the release of new Scottish Government funds towards play park development, Renfrewshire Council have agreed not only to make up the rest of the £150,000 needed for the play park, but also to make our park one of the first spaces they regenerate. Work should be completed in summer 2022.\n\n• Our committee are continuing to raise funds for an intergenerational seating area, as well as separate area for teenagers. Working with a group of 12-14 year olds we applied successfully to the Celebrating Renfrewshire (Villages) fund for £2700 towards the latter project; the girls made a TikTok video for their application, informed by the Make Space For Girls campaign which suggests ways of making public spaces more accessible to teenage girls.","src/content/projects/project-4.md","2db0cd045b75de38",{"html":172,"metadata":173},"\u003Ch3 id=\"lochwinnoch-recreation-park-update-30724\">Lochwinnoch Recreation Park update (30/7/24)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The teen shelter has been installed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/projects/project-4_01.jpg\" alt=\"Project preview\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"lochwinnoch-recreation-park-update-march-2024\">Lochwinnoch Recreation Park update (March 2024)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>in addition to the work that has been completed – the planned mural has been painted on the wall facing onto the play area.

I previously worked as a Project Development Manager for Craft Town Scotland in West Kilbride for a number of years. During my time with The Barony Centre I managed multiple, integral community projects as well as the exhibitions and community spaces. I have experience in working with various groups of volunteers- we simply couldn’t run the community without you. I look forward to getting to know you all as the project unfolds and making Lochhead Gardens a beautiful community space for all to enjoy.\n\n### April 2024\n\nWe have just received significant funding from a 3 year award from the National Lottery Community Fund and the Renfrewshire Council Sustainable Communities Fund to help us take forward the development of the garden site. These monies will enable us to make some real progress with the basic groundworks before moving on to the installation of some of the buildings and facilities as initially planned.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"columns: min(22rem, 72vw); margin-block: 2rem\">\n\n![Project preview](/projects/project-3_01.png)\n\n![Project preview](/projects/project-3_02.png)\n\n![Project preview](/projects/project-3_03.png)\n\n![Project preview](/projects/project-3_04.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n \n### March 2024\nWe are delighted to announce that, thanks to funding from the Greater Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Local Action Group and Renfrewshire Council Villages Investment Fund, water & waste have been connected to the site in preparation for connection to the Toilet/Storage when built in the coming weeks.\n\nA Community update leaflet can be viewed here\n\nLCDT has been working on the Lochhead Avenue site for three years. During the Covid crisis we installed over 20 raised beds for growing vegetables to support residents who were unable to access shops. This has now evolved into a space which hosts the Lochwinnoch Community Larder operated by a local charity LEAP, which has become a thriving hub of community activity, offering dignified food provision to over 900 people in the area. Their project receives surplus food from supermarkets and redistributes it to the community. LEAP has also used it as a site for outdoor workshops during the Feel Good Festivals.\n\nA number of other groups also use the site, including Wildcare, a Social Enterprise holiday club offering outdoor childcare during school holidays, Lochwinnoch Force For Nature, a local biodiversity group which uses the site for growing sacrificial crops for wildlife and a local Home Education group which has social meet-ups on the site.\n\n### What we plan to do:\n\nTo find out the priorities of the community and residents we held several community consultations which identified a number of potential ideas. We then commissioned a professional landscape designer who produced a bold and imaginative plan based on these ideas (outlined below).\n\nWe do not want to overdevelop this site. The main features of the plan are:\n\n#### The Hub\n\nThe Community Larder and smaller cabin, providing a meeting/consultation room for hire, will continue to offer a welcoming entrance. Planned is a larger seating area here with tables and a pizza oven, and a toilet block on the other side of the entrance.\n\n#### Market / Large Event Space\n\nFrom the entrance hub, the main route will lead to the centre of the garden where a large open space is provided for markets. The types of markets suggested are farmer’s markets, zero waste, food and craft fairs. Next to the central open space a large covered wood structure will offer an undercover space for workshops, gatherings, meetings or informal seating.\n\n#### Play / Workshops / Education\n\nFrom this open space, paths lead to quiet seating spaces settled amongst the trees, and a deck that can be used for open-air yoga classes or home education outdoors. A raised walkway will form part of the main pathway to the south of the site through the existing trees, offering dry footing over what can be sporadically wet ground leading onto an open greenspace which can continue to be used by Wildcare and home education groups. A sensory maze nearby will offer plants to stimulate the senses. Some of these areas will be available for hire for kids parties along with equipment such as bell tents and inflatables.\n\n#### Growing Vegetables and Fruit\n\nA growing space could be used for community growing in some capacity. The raised beds of a variety of sizes and shapes suitable for different ages and mobilities could be for growing annual veg, perennial veg and/or for a soft-fruit cage. We will potentially build a polytunnel or polycrub, and look at supporting seed saving initiatives here.\n\n#### Pond & Wildlife\n\nA large pond surrounded by a beach and planting areas will offer a different type of habitat encouraging more wildlife to use the site. The adjacent bramble grove will retain a large patch of brambles that are an essential shelter and food source for birds as well as a large variety of species. Brambles can also be eaten by people who use the garden. A significant area has been set aside for long grass and wildflower plants and much of the southwest boundary will be left with the existing undisturbed vegetation.\n\n#### Community Orchard\n\nAn orchard for fruit trees, such as apples, cherries, pears, & plums will be set within a meadow. Within the orchard, benches and picnic tables create an informal place for eating or meeting, or a place just to enjoy the buzz of meadow.\n\nWe think this is a unique and exciting opportunity to enhance the environment of the village.
