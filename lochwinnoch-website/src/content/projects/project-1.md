LCDT are happy to announce we are supporting the Men’s Shed group in Lochwinnoch. The new Shed will be located in our new Community garden space at Lochhead Garden.

The group are looking to create a safe place where likeminded people can gather, share ideas, skills and take some time to pursue projects big or small.

We have the support of the SMSA (Scottish Men’s Shed association) and are excited about what this may bring for the Men’s Shed Group.
